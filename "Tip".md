Tips for students learning Programming fundamentals:

Although there are many important concepts and pieces of knowledge when it comes to programming, I think there are some key things that top this list.
First, I think knowing the basics is always important, whether it is programming or anything else. For example in math, everything builds up on each other, such as powers building on multiplication building on addition. 
This is the same with programming and python. Understanding basic data sets such as str, int, and bool become important as they are built upon for other data sets such as list, dictionary, etc. This can also create connections which can help you learn faster.
