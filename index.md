## About Me

My name is Yuto Inoue.
I am a student at Uni High in Sophomore year learning the fundamentals of programming.
This class has been the first time I really took time learning python and I enjoyed it very much.
I hope to continue coding even after I finish this course and improve my skills as a programmer.

## About My Project

Creating Pong game in Python for University Laboratory High School Computer Programming 2024 Fall course.
The purpose of this project is to learn how to use new python modules pygame and create a game from scratch.
It will include both a one player (vs ai) and two player mode, as well as a main menu with buttons to operate.
