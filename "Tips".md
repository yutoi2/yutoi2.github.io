Tips for students learning Programming fundamentals:

First, I think knowing the basics is always important, whether it is programming or anything else. For example in math, everything builds up on each other, such as powers building on multiplication building on addition. This is the same with programming and python. Understanding basic data sets such as str, int, and bool become important as they are built upon for other data sets such as list, dictionary, etc. This can also create connections which can help you learn faster. On the topic of connections, through this course I learned that making connections can be very helpful. Although it was not my favorite section to complete on our debriefs every mission, it was certainly helpful at times. I think it helps (at least for me) to understand and retain the information better, so I can use it later. 

Another thing I found important was working on it everyday. Similar to many other activities such as sport and music, improving your skills require constant dedication. I remember coming back from thanksgiving and having some trouble recalling the concepts we were working on worked, which was caused by the fact that I hardly coded over break. Reviewing what you learned, doing some practice problems, and even learning more every day - maybe only for like 15 minutes - is something that can help people really improve and retain their knowledge in my opinion. However along with this, I also think that too much coding and not taking breaks can be bad. I have had multiple experiences of missing simple mistakes or overlooking easier solutions, due to the fact that I was narrow-minded and had my head full from long periods of coding. If I had given it a little break, I would've understood what to do better, which helped me when completing stressful missions in our class. 

Finally, ask questions. Programming can get difficult and complicated at times, and asking questions can help a lot. For example during our class on recursion, I was quite confused on how the code worked. If it weren't for anoter person asking a question about the concept, I wouldn't have been able to understand well enough to be able to possibly use it in the future. I learned that there is no need to be afraid to ask questions. It can only benefit you. And plus, whoever you ask is probably going to be happy that you asked them so it is a win-win.

Overall my main tips include:
- Make sure your understanding of the basics is good
- Create connections between concepts you learn
- Work on programming every day, but don't over work; taking breaks can help
- Don't be afraid to ask questions.

Over this semester, my view on coding has changed a lot. At the beginning of this course, I thought that coding and programming was very hard and required a lot of intelligence to do. Everyone I knew who programmed were extremely smart! But as we started the course, I found out that it's not as hard as it seems. Now I also learned that it's not easy; it requires lots of patience and critical thinking, as well as cause lots of stress, late nights, and errors. However, at this point of time, I have come to enjoy coding. I enjoy coding with my friends and I have had lots of fun during this project. Every problem I solve, I feel a sense of accomplishment, which is the same feeling I have playing sports. To conclude, this course and experience has changed my view on programming to be something that is fun. 

I hope and believe that future and current learners of programming will also be able to find it fun to learn and can solve all their errors in their code.
