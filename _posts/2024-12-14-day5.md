- Logged on to code and my code wouldn't work
  - When I ran, python would crash
    - very despair like feeling
  - Couldn't find what was causing it to crash
    - Lots of commenting and deleting to see what was causing
      - Couldnt really find out
  - Started rewriting my whole code
    - Finally worked
- Continued watching tutorial
  - Stuff like adding score, collision and cpu
    - Score was very easy
      - Was just missing stuff that prevented infinite score glitch
        - Kinda disappointed I couldn't do
    - Collision was also easy
      - What I had been learning
      - I knew how to do but I thought I didn't because I didn't make collision for the class
        - Forgot class was built off of Rect class which DID have collision
    - I made CPU as well while also working on two player
      - Have both versions
- Found some possible issues
  - The game is very easy... idk how you're supposed to get scored on
    - Cpu hardly misses
      - Maybe add a delay of some sort?
    - Also changing speed based on number of hits or something?
  - A bug where when you try to hit the ball at top or bottom of paddle it like bounces off the paddle multiple times or phases through
    - Also when ball is too fast collision can't be detected
      - Probably cause it's not really moving it's just changing position really quickly?
  - Not sure how to switch between 1 and 2 playet yet
  - Goal to fix bugs, make more interesting, and add menu type thing
    - Also watch last part of tutorial
    - Could also compare with other tutorial to see if it can be made better
