Today I worked on implementing a main menu into my game to switch between one player and two player mode. To complete this, I first watched a youtube tutorial on creating pressable buttons, which required a button class. The class included code to convert images into buttons, drawing it, and making it so that when it is pressed it can do some sort of action. After implementing the button class, I messed around on my code and tried to make it so that it can switch screens. Surprisingly, I was able to succeed in doing so and created a play button. Just to make sure, I watched a tutorial on creating menus with these buttons to make some minor adjustments, so that my code works better.

- First struggled with changing the screen
  - "Changing" but in reality just overlaying a new screen
  - Buttons showed up on wrong screen
- Then wrote code to open pause screen and go back to home screen
- Realized some other problems with my code such as returning the winner of the round
  - Realized its kinda hard to center words because the input coordinate is the top left of the word
- Added game_state variables to determine if its paused or home
  - My code is getting complicated with lots of branching which I should fix
