- Watched tutorial
  - They put the things I made in a class
    - More organized
  - Discussed stuff not sure about with friend
    - Doing different projects but some similarities so helping each other understand
- Not sure purpose of fps yet
  - Caused ball to not move well
- Edited ball so it will bounce at the inside of a paddle
  - It doesn't really work just visually pleasing
  - Trying to fix so that the paddle has to be there to bounce
- Continued watching tutorial
  - Saw how they made the ball
  - I had movement and stuff like paddle but they put in class
    - Lots of class stuff so reviewed in Training 27
- Tried collision but forgot new class so methods are differnet
  - Looked for how the colliderect method made
  - Not sure how to do yet
    - Python crashed during attempts to do
  - Will watch tutorial for collision tomorrow
- Was shocked that *= was a thing like += and -=
